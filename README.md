# ColorVarsSC
A stylesheet for Sugarcube projects that replaces all the static colors of default elements with variables. As a bonus, it also does this for fonts. Made to be easily used with Realtime Colors.
# How to Use
Simply copy the contents of stylesheet.css and paste them into the stylesheet of your Twine/Tweego project. If you've already styled some of the default elements, you may need to do some adjusting.
# Using with Realtime Colors
If you want to use a theme generated with [Realtime Colors](https://www.realtimecolors.com), go ahead and generate and modify a theme as you usually would, then click "Export," make sure the "CSS" tab is selected, turn on the "Shades" toggle, and copy. Then paste this into the colors section of the stylesheet.
